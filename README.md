# LISTAPI
Simple website and database used to run the list.exploitsearch.net site.

While this project was not created in such a way that someone else could easily deploy it on their own server, it should not be too difficult to do.


My goal with this project was to create a simple web based project that would server as a easy way to access common data that I typically use during penetration tests.  This data can be, common passwords, common usernames, database tables, etc...

By making use of either the web based user interface or through use of direct queries via curl, wget, etc... one is able to retrieve the desired list.

A live version of this project can be seen at [list.exploitsearch.net](list.exploitsearch.net).
